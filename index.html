		<p id="intro">This site is the hub for the concept and background of Alien Nations. In this game, the player controls Spurdo, a wandering space walrus intent on making trade with alien societies. Spurdo will have to travel between planets, avoiding hazards along the way. His trusty companian a.k.a. lazy hitchhiker Owen is there to accompany him in his trade conquests.</p>
